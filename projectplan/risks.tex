    R1 & Member of the group are ill and this will cause a shift in the plan.   & Moderate       & Marginal\\

    R2 & Change in requirements and design are proposed.                        & Moderate       & Critical\\

    R3 & Architectural components cannot support the load of requests.          & Low            & Critical\\

    R4 & Faults in external components used (i.e. Google Maps, PayPal)          & Low            & Catastrophic\\

    \textbf{Risk} & \textbf{Recovery Action}\\ 
    \hline 
    
    R1 & Organize tasks in resource allocation so that more overlapping are present. \\
    \hline
    R2 & Make a clear and traceable RASD and DD and project a flexible architecture, so that changing are less effective.\\
    \hline
    R3 & Project the physical architecture of the system so that it can be distributed and easily expandable. \\
    \hline
    R4 & Take into account different alternatives for external components and implement different interfaces for the different ones. It will be possible to change the components used easily.\\
    \hline
    R5 & Consider the possibility of redundancy of the most critical architectural components (for example Open Street Maps instead of Google Maps and Skrill instead of PayPal).\\
    \hline
    R6 & Investigate the possibility to buy already done component to be integrated in the application and not implemented from scratch.\\
