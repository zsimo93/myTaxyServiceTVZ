\subsubsection{Design}
An in-depth look at the code has shown a different problem: in many cases the code goes up to 5 levels of if clauses as in lines \textit{1340-1355} and in general in our class there are 169 if clauses out of 1662 lines of code (counted with comments and empty lines). That's about 10\% of the total lines, and gives a clear idea of the problem: the project seems to have quite a good high level architecture, but quite a bad code-level design.\\
Furthermore, the only comments are used to enforce a really bad practice: they tell the reader that a parameter should not be used (symptom of a really bad design).

\subsubsection{Implementation}
TODO comments are still present \textit{486, 1615} in the code and also a FIX ME \textit{1100}.
