\begin{itemize}
\item [28.] All class members (of our code block) have the correct visibility (they are all private except the one defined in the interface implemented). All variables and class members are of the type required by their usage and so they can be considered as correct.
\item [29.] Variable scoping is done really well. Every variable is declared exactly when it is needed and never before.
\item [30.] Every new object is instantiated through the constructor.
\item [31-32.] All the variables are initialized immediately after the declaration. Furthermore the methods are always invoked with correct parameters and therefore parameters references are correctly initialized.
\item [33.] Some variables aren't declared at the beginning of a block. \textit{Lines 1339, 1405, 1472, 1609, 1616-1617, 1622}
