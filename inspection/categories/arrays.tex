\begin{itemize}
\item [37.] The collections used are always entirely scanned and the items of the collections are always accessed through the \textit{get(i)} or \textit{item(i)} methods. \textit{Lines 1342, 1409, 1420, 1579}.
\item [38.] The collections used are always scanned in for statements that use the exit condition \textit{i $<$ array.getLength()} (or \textit{array.size()}) with i=0 and incremented by one at every iteration. So no index goes out of bound. \textit{1341, 1408, 1578}.
\item [39.] No array is created and no elements are added to Collections used.
