\item [52-53.] Not only exceptions are never handled, as it can be seen by the fact that the general unchecked \textit{Exception} is thrown by method definitions at  \textit{lines 1317, 1383, 1447}. Furthermore the only try/catch block in the code, handles the exception in the really worst way possible: it hides the exception and generates a new one which is the only allowed by the interface specification.
