\begin{itemize}
\item [20-21.] The only file of our block contains just three classes and no interfaces of which the only public class is the first.
\item [22.] The method resolveEntity is consistent with the javadoc, besides it doesn't throw \textit{IOException}.
\item [23.] The javadoc doesn't cover \textit{generateWorkSecurityMap}, \textit{generateSecurityMap} and \textit{generateResourceAdapterConfig} probably because they are private methods.
