\item [1-7.] Naming convention has been correctly taken into account. In fact constants are always in upper case and the classic camel case standard is used (upper camel case for class and interface names and lower camel case for variable names and parameters) with the only exception of a variable at \textit{line 1403}. Furthermore all the constants, variables, classes and interfaces used or defined have a name that clearly explains their meaning.
