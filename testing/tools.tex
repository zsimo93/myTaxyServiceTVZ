\section{Tools and Test Equipment Required}

\subsection {Travis CI - https://travis-ci.org/}
Travis CI, as Continuous Integration Platforms in general, is becoming really popular in the latest years. It is useful in agile development environments, where code changes are integrated to the baseline daily. \\
It therefore will be used to make sure that the development process is consistent as the time goes by, dramatically reducing integration efforts at the end of the developing phase.
    
\subsection {Mockito - http://mockito.org/}
Mockito is a Mocking framework which is useful both for unit testing and for integration testing. It not only makes it possible to produce atomic unit tests, but it is also powerful in more complex contexts.\\
In particular it will be used to concretely create stubs and drivers which will be defined for specific tests later.
