\subsection{Product perspective}
The name of the application is MyTaxiService.
The pre-existent taxi service system consists of databases containing taxis and drivers. 
The users interact with the system from different operating systems both on desktop and mobile devices. \sout{ Passengers and Drivers using the application must have a GPS-enabled device which is \textit{necessary }for the system to detect their current positions.}
Supported mobile devices are only limited to those having one of the following operating systems, screen sizes or browser:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mobile:
\begin{itemize}
\item iOS v.7 to 9 and future versions
\item Android 4.2 to 5 and future versions
\item \sout{Screen sizes strating from 4.2'}
\end{itemize}
\item Desktop
\begin{itemize}
\item Browser Chrome (v.46+)
\item Browser Internet Explorer (v.11+ or Edge)
\item Browser Firefox (v. 21+)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Dispatches in case of new taxi request were forwarded to drivers by radio, so the previous system hasn't got any particular information system.
The application will have access to the DBs so it will need an interface with the current DBMS.
It will also have an interface for the users and another one for the administrators.
