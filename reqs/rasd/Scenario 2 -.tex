\subsection{Scenario 2: Taxi reservation}
Bob is abroad on holiday and is going to take a plane to go back to his city, but he realizes that no one can take him back home from the airport, so he decides to book a taxi ride. His smartphone is dead so he turns on his laptop, connects to airport's wi-fi and opens the \textit{mytaxiservice.com} website. He signs in with his credentials and opens the \textit{"New Ride"} view. He selects the starting place(the airport), the destination ("21st avenue"), and chooses the departing time. During his flight he charges his mobile phone so when he lands he turns his mobile phone on and receives all the information about his reservation. At the booked time the taxi arrives and brings him home. The taxi driver communicates him the ride fare and he pays in cash.
