The mobile application will be suitable for devices with screen sizes starting from 4.2â€™
\subsubsection{Interfaces to other applications}

\subsubsection{Reliability requirements}

\subsubsection{Criticality of the application}
The application doesn't have a critical role inside the taxi system, since any of the actions done by MyTaxiService, can by accomplished by phone.
\subsubsection{Safety and security considerations}
Since the payments are processed externally and the data is handled by an external DBMS, there are no specific security issues.
