\subsection{Scenario 1: Usage of the app}
Timmy needs a taxi to go back to his hotel in Sesame Street. So he picks up his phone and opens the "MyTaxiService" app.
He is asked to allow the application to use his position and after that, he's asked to pick a destination. He writes "Serame Street", but the application doesn't recognize this place and suggests "Were you looking for "Sesame Street" perhaps?". He chooses "yes" and then he is asked to wait a moment.
After few seconds, a popup appears on the screen containing the taxi code, the EWT for the taxi, the ETA to home and the expected far.
He waits for the taxi to arrive and after he's back home, he's notified of the fare which is directly drawn from his credit card.
