\subsection{Scenario 4:}
Carl, a taxi driver for the myTaxiService company, is driving along "Main Street" when he receives a notification from the taxi application for a shared ride. He accepts the request and goes at the first address given to take the first passenger. After driving for a few minutes he stops to take other two passengers and his car is now full. So he drives to the first destination and tell the passenger the fare that will be charged on his Paypal account. Then he drives to the last stop and leaves the last passengers, takes the payment in cash and terminate the current ride on the app.
